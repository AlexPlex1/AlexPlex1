### Hi there!👋 I'm Alex 😁
Welcome to my Github!

##About me
I started my professional career in the world of SAP as an ABAP Developer, as part of a team based in Italy where we created apps for a company in the fashion industry.
After staying in that role for about 2.5 years I made the decision to make a career change and follow my passion for data. I completed a bootcamp in data analytics and completed the transition within my company.
I believe data is of immense value to every company and our everyday lives, helping us make informed decisions and avoid costly mistakes. That and alongside the technology used in this field, which I find extremely 
interesting are the reasons I decided to pursue a career in data.

I'm currently focused on expanding my knowledge of the following technologies which cover the majority of tools a Data Analyst uses:

 - Python (and relevant libraries like pandas)
 - SQL
 - Power BI and DAX

In the future, after gaining the experience needed, I'd also like to learn more about Data Engineering and Data Science tools.
